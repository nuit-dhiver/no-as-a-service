## 🚀 API Usage

**Base URL**
```
https://naas.isalman.dev/no
```

**Method:** `GET`  
**Rate Limit:** `120 requests per minute per IP`

### 🔄 Example Request
```http
GET /no
```

### ✅ Example Response
```json
{
  "reason": "This feels like something Future Me would yell at Present Me for agreeing to."
}
```

Use it in apps, bots, landing pages, Slack integrations, rejection letters, or wherever you need a polite (or witty) no.

### 🧠 Contextual AI Rejections

Self-hosted deployments can also generate a rejection related to a specific message:

```http
POST /no/ai
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "message": "Can you work this weekend?",
  "tone": "funny"
}
```

Supported tones are `polite`, `funny`, `professional`, `dramatic`, and `chaotic`. If `tone` is missing or invalid, the API uses `funny`.

When an AI provider is configured, the response looks like:

```json
{
  "reason": "I respect the invite, but my weekend has filed a formal objection.",
  "ai": true,
  "tone": "funny"
}
```

If no provider is configured, or the provider is unavailable, the endpoint falls back to a random response:

```json
{
  "reason": "This feels like something Future Me would yell at Present Me for agreeing to.",
  "ai": false,
  "fallback": "random"
}
```

To enable OpenAI:

```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key npm start
```

You can override the model with `OPENAI_MODEL`. The default is `gpt-5.2`.
